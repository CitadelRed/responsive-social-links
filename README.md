Hello everybody,

Here's an example of social media icon code minus the social media icon images.
emphasis using hover is achieved here using colors. This allows the user to identify that these icons are clickable.
use different colors of icon with the same shape of icon. png images are reccomended. Perhaps you can use svg too.
the icons were copyrighted but imagine each icon for facebook is the same shape, each icon for insta is the same shape,
but each color of icons is in an images folder, each under a seperate subfolder per each color.

there's a drop-shadow in the css that only works for png files, as far as I know. It works with transparent backgrounds.
You can remove it as you wish. 

Hope you enjoy copying this code as a shortcut as much as I enjoyed creating it.
